I started to learn how to develop software back in school. I got a Video2Brain DVD about C++ borrowed by a teacher and then the magic happened. The first programs I developed back then were games but I switched to websites quite quickly. I started with PHP, but again, switched very fast to much more suited languages and frameworks like Python, Ruby etc.

After School I finished an apprenticeship as software engineer, worked at T-Systems and added a study in business economics to be fully equipped to help companies getting ready for the digitized future with IoT and Industry 4.0.

Today I'm a Java (Spring Boot) backend engineer and a Python engineer for websites and more. I always try to find new challenges.

In my freetime I also work a lot with Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc. to build own devices, e.g. for automation and a underwater ROV (submarine drone) but also enjoy climbing and hiking.
